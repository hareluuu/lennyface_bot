This is the first bot I have ever made and I'm really happy I got it to work without any major problems.

It is really really simple, it just grabs comments from a subreddit (in this case r/funny), then it loops throught them all looking for the lenny face (( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), if it finds one then it replies with a winking lenny face and that's basically all there is to it :thumbsup:
